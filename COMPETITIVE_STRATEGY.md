## Strategy to Outrank RJS Groundworks

### Phase 1: GBP Optimization (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Complete Profile Optimization
- [ ] **Verify profile** (if not already verified)
- [ ] **Set as Service Area Business** (you can still rank without physical address)
- [ ] **Add ALL service areas** (Bath, Bristol, Chippenham, etc.)
- [ ] **Optimize business description** with keywords:
  - "Resin driveways Bath"
  - "15-year guarantee"
  - "20+ years experience"
  - "NVQ qualified"
  - "Eco-friendly resin driveways"

#### 1.2 Category Strategy
**Primary Category:** `Resin Driveway Installer` (more specific than "Driveway Contractor")

**Secondary Categories:**
- `Driveway Contractor`
- `Landscaper`
- `Tarmac Contractor`
- `Hardscaping Contractor`

#### 1.3 Keywords in Business Name

- **Note:** Only if Google allows - don't keyword stuff

### Phase 2: Content & Engagement (Week 2-4)

#### 2.1 Aggressive Photo Strategy

1. **Before & After Sets** (10-15 sets)
   - Show dramatic transformations
   - Highlight your specialization

2. **15-Year Guarantee Visuals**
   - Create graphics showing "15-Year Guarantee"
   - Add to project photos

3. **Qualification Certificates**
   - Photos of NVQ, CPCS, City & Guilds certificates
   - Builds trust and credibility

4. **Eco-Friendly Focus**

A: Yes! We offer a 15-year guarantee on all resin driveway installations - one of the longest guarantees in the industry. We're fully qualified (NVQ, CPCS, City & Guilds, SWQR) and fully insured.

**Q: Are resin driveways environmentally friendly?**
A: Absolutely! Our resin driveways are permeable, allowing water to drain naturally. We use environmentally conscious materials and work with deep respect for nature and local wildlife. This is a key part of our approach.

**Q: How long have you been installing driveways in Bath?**
A: Bath Resin Company was established in 2004 - that's over 20 years of experience! We're a family-run business with three generations of expertise in resin driveways and landscaping across Bath, Somerset, and Wiltshire.

**Q: What qualifications do your team have?**
